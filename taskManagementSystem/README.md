# Project Idea: Personal Task Management System
## Overview:
Develop a Personal Task Management System where users can create, track, and manage their tasks or to-do lists. This application will help users organize their daily activities, set reminders, and track task completion.


Task Prioritization:


- [x]  Allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) and visually distinguish tasks based on priority.
Recurring Tasks:


- [ ]  Implement functionality for recurring tasks (e.g., daily, weekly) and automatically create new tasks based on the recurrence pattern.
Data Visualization:


- [ ]  Provide charts or graphs to visualize task completion rates, overdue tasks, or time spent on different categories.
Integration with Calendar:


- [ ]  Integrate with a calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar) to sync tasks and reminders.
Mobile Compatibility:


- [ ]  Ensure the application is responsive or develop a basic mobile app version if desired.


## GOAL:
A Personal Task Management System is a manageable yet sufficiently 
complex project for a capstone. It involves user authentication, 
CRUD operations, notifications, and responsive design,
demonstrating a range of essential web development skills 
while remaining achievable within a typical capstone timeframe.

## Features  
  ### User Authentication:
- [x]  Implement [user registration] and [login] so that users can manage their own tasks.

### Task Creation and Management: 
- [x]  Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
- [x]  Include fields for task title, description, due date, and priority level.
Task Organization:


- [x]  Enable users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping) and view tasks by category.
Implement sorting and filtering options (e.g., by due date, priority).

Reminders and Notifications:
- [ ]  Allow users to set reminders for tasks and send email or in-app notifications when due dates approach.

Task Status Tracking:
- [x]  Provide options to mark tasks as completed or in-progress.

- [ ]  Display a dashboard showing completed tasks and upcoming deadlines.

### Task Prioritization:


- [x]  Allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) and visually distinguish tasks based on priority.
Recurring Tasks:


- [ ]  Implement functionality for recurring tasks (e.g., daily, weekly) and automatically create new tasks based on the recurrence pattern.
Data Visualization:


- [ ]  Provide charts or graphs to visualize task completion rates, overdue tasks, or time spent on different categories.
Integration with Calendar:


- [ ]  Integrate with a calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar) to sync tasks and reminders.
Mobile Compatibility:


- [x]  Ensure the application is responsive or develop a basic mobile app version if desired.

## Tech Stack  
**Client:** TypeScript, React, Next.js  

**Backend:** Python with Django for the application logic and API

**Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing task data and user information.

**Frontend:** Use Django templates for the web interface or integrate a frontend framework like Bootstrap for a more polished look.

**Notifications:**  Use Djangoâ€™s email functionality for sending reminders.
